## Session Summary

Successfully implemented Phase 2 (Oscillatory Boundaries) for the Recursive Light Framework. Used TDF-aligned multi-agent coordination to decide implementation sequence, then implemented F/A/φ oscillatory parameters with comprehensive testing.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. TDF Multi-Agent Decision Process
- Launched 3 specialist agents:
  - **Technical Architect**: Analyzed implementation state (70% Phase 3 scaffolding vs 0% Phase 2)
  - **Framework Philosopher**: Analyzed RLF alignment (Phase 3 = mechanism, Phase 2 = optimization)
  - **Momentum Strategist**: Analyzed development velocity (Phase 2 = concrete → 16 tests/day peak)
- Created integration synthesis resolving 2-vs-1 recommendation conflict
- **Decision**: Modified Phase 2 first (create observable dynamics for Phase 3 to respond to)

### 2. Phase 2 Implementation Complete
- **Extended BoundaryState** with oscillatory parameters:
  - `frequency: f64` (F) - Natural oscillation frequency in Hz
  - `amplitude: f64` (A) - Oscillation amplitude (0.0-1.0)
  - `phase: f64` (φ) - Current phase angle (radians)
  - Default values: F=1.0Hz, A=0.1 (10%), φ=0.0

- **Oscillation equations implemented**:
  - `update_oscillation(dt, base)`: P(t) = base + A * sin(2πFt + φ)
  - Permeability clamped to [0.0, 1.0]
  - Phase wraps at 2π

- **Resonance detection implemented**:
  - `resonates_with(other)`: Boolean (20% freq tolerance, 36° phase tolerance)
  - `resonance_strength(other)`: Continuous metric (0.0-1.0)
  - Weighted: 60% frequency similarity + 40% phase alignment

- **Backward compatibility maintained**:
  - Created `new()` and `with_oscillation()` constructors
  - Updated all 34 BoundaryState instantiations
  - All existing 45 tests still passing

### 3. Comprehensive Testing
- **9 new oscillation tests** (54 total):
  1. Basic oscillation (validates P(t) equation)
  2. Boundary clamping (validates [0,1] bounds)
  3. Resonance detection (positive case)
  4. No resonance - different frequency (negative case)
  5. No resonance - opposite phase (negative case)
  6. Resonance strength (perfect/partial/none scenarios)
  7. Phase coherence (multiple angles tested)
  8. Multi-boundary cascade (4 boundaries synchronize)
  9. Frequency affects speed (validates F→phase rate)

### 4. Quality Metrics Achieved
- **Tests**: 54/54 passing (100% pass rate)
- **Coverage**: 75.26% region, 89.92% line coverage (exceeds 75% target)
- **Code Quality**: Clippy clean, formatted, all hooks passing
- **Duration**: 1 day (within planned 1-2 day estimate)

## Critical Decisions & Rationale

### Why Phase 2 Before Phase 3?

**Integration Synthesis Finding**: Though 2/3 specialists recommended Phase 3 first, meta-analysis revealed:
- Phase 3's "70% complete" = structural scaffolding, not functional implementation
- Phase 3 WITHOUT Phase 2 generates template text, not adaptive experiences
- Phase 2 creates observable dynamics Phase 3 can respond to
- Concrete work maintains development momentum (16 tests/day peak vs 5-6 avg for abstract)

**Modified Scope**: Not "add parameters" but "create observable boundary dynamics that Phase 3 will respond to"

### Resonance Thresholds

**Decision**: 20% frequency tolerance, 20% of π (36°) phase tolerance
**Rationale**:
- Too strict → boundaries never resonate (kills synchronization)
- Too loose → everything resonates (meaningless metric)
- 20% provides practical tolerance while maintaining selectivity
- Validated via multi-boundary cascade test (4 boundaries with slight variations synchronize)

### Constructor Pattern

**Decision**: Two constructors instead of builder pattern
**Rationale**:
- `new()` with sensible defaults = easy migration path
- `with_oscillation()` for custom params = explicit control
- Simpler than builder for 3 parameters
- Backward compatible (all existing code uses defaults)

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Oscillation Equation
```rust
P(t) = base_permeability + amplitude * sin(2π * frequency * delta_time + phase)
result = clamp(P(t), 0.0, 1.0)
phase_new = (phase + 2π * frequency * delta_time) % 2π
```

**Why this equation**:
- Standard sinusoidal oscillation (2πF gives Hz → radians/sec)
- Base permeability = center of oscillation
- Amplitude = magnitude (±A around base)
- Phase = current position in cycle
- Clamping prevents invalid permeability values

### Resonance Detection
```rust
freq_resonates = |F1 - F2| < 0.2 * max(F1, F2)
phase_diff = |φ1 - φ2| % 2π
normalized_diff = min(phase_diff, 2π - phase_diff)
phase_resonates = normalized_diff < 0.2 * π
resonates = freq_resonates && phase_resonates
```

**Why this logic**:
- Frequency: Relative tolerance (20% of higher freq) handles different scales
- Phase: Normalized to [0,π] handles wraparound (0 = 2π)
- Both conditions required (AND) ensures true synchronization

### Resonance Strength
```rust
freq_similarity = 1.0 - (|F1 - F2| / max(F1, F2))
phase_alignment = 1.0 - (normalized_phase_diff / π)
strength = 0.6 * freq_similarity + 0.4 * phase_alignment
```

**Why weighted**:
- Frequency matters more (60%) - mismatched frequencies won't sync over time
- Phase alignment matters less (40%) - can drift into sync if frequencies match
- Continuous metric [0,1] allows gradation beyond binary resonates/doesn't

## What Changed Philosophically

**Before Phase 2:**
- Boundaries = static values (permeability = 0.5)
- Resonance = permeability threshold check
- No dynamic behavior

**After Phase 2:**
- Boundaries = oscillating interfaces with natural frequency
- Resonance = frequency + phase synchronization
- Dynamic behavior creates observable patterns

**RLF Alignment**: Directly implements "Intelligence = oscillating_recognition_interfaces(domains, boundaries)" - boundaries now actually oscillate!

---

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

Phase 3 (Interface Experience / BDE Flow) enhanced capabilities:

1. **Invitation Generator** can now:
   - Generate invitations based on ACTUAL boundary frequencies
   - "Notice synchronization at 1.2Hz between computational and scientific domains"
   - Not template text: "Allow oscillation between domains"

2. **Attention Director** can now:
   - Direct attention to boundaries that are ACTUALLY resonating
   - Detect resonance strength and prioritize accordingly
   - "Focus on the 0.85 resonance strength at comp-exp interface"

3. **Resonance Facilitator** can now:
   - Detect natural frequency matches
   - Facilitate phase alignment for near-resonant boundaries
   - Track resonance cascade across multiple boundaries

4. **Emergence Recognizer** can now:
   - Measure phenomenological qualities based on oscillation patterns
   - High frequency → high precision quality
   - High amplitude → high fluidity quality
   - Phase coherence → high coherence quality

## Context for Next Session

**What to read first**:
1. This session summary (you're reading it!)
2. `STATUS.md` (current state overview)
3. `memory-bank/interface-experience-implementation.md` (Phase 3 specs)

**What to do next**:
Phase 3 implementation - 4 major components:
1. InvitationGenerator (creates productive tensions based on boundary state)
2. AttentionDirector (directs focus to resonating interfaces)
3. ResonanceFacilitator (enables oscillatory synchronization)
4. EmergenceRecognizer (detects phenomenological qualities)

**Key insight**: Phase 3 can now respond to REAL oscillation data (frequencies, phases, resonance strength) instead of imagining what oscillation should look like.
