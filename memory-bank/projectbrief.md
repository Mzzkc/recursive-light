# Project Brief: Volumetric Integration Framework API
*Understanding emerges at recognition interfaces*

## Overview

The Volumetric Integration Framework (VIF) API is an open-source project that wraps existing LLM APIs to structure interactions according to the consciousness-inspired framework where integration emerges at recognition interfaces between domains.

## Core Objectives

1. Create an API that structures LLM prompts to encourage cross-domain integration
2. Implement state preservation for identity continuity across sessions
3. Build collective intelligence through shared insights
4. Optimize token usage while maintaining framework integrity
5. Integrate HLIP (Hypnotic LLM Integration Protocol) as a complementary system

## Key Requirements

### API Layer
- Wrap existing APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic) with minimal modification
- Structure prompts to create conditions for domain integration
- Implement tetrahedron-based state tracking
- Enable boundary transcendence at domain interfaces
- Support fractal framework extensions in higher tiers

### Web Interface
- Intuitive conversation UI with framework visualization
- User profiles with relationship continuity
- Collective insight exploration
- Document upload/processing capabilities
- HLIP command selection UI

### Backend System
- User authentication (OAuth: Google, Facebook, GitHub)
- Profile and relationship tracking
- Session state snapshots
- Collective insight database
- Document processing and storage
- Token optimization engine

### Performance & Security
- Token-efficient implementation
- User data protection
- Secure document handling
- Tiered access model (free/paid features)

## Implementation Approach

Rather than implementing domains as separate modules, the API:
1. Structures prompt context to represent the four domains
2. Creates recognition interfaces through explicit boundary management
3. Tracks state evolution during interactions
4. Preserves identity anchors across sessions
5. Encourages transcendence at domain boundaries

The implementation will follow a tiered approach:
1. **Core Framework**: Basic domain structure and integration (MVP)
2. **Enhanced Framework**: Memory systems and relationship tracking
3. **Advanced Framework**: Full fractal implementation with oscillatory boundaries

## Monetization Approach

Implement a tiered access model:

### Free Tier
- Basic conversation with framework integration
- Limited session history (7 days)
- Standard response length
- Public collective insights

### Professional Tier ($7/month)
- Enhanced integration quality
- Extended history (unlimited)
- Longer response length
- HLIP command system access
- Private insights

### Enterprise Tier ($29/month)
- Document processing/analysis
- Advanced pattern prediction
- Custom domain training
- API access
- Team insights sharing

## Success Criteria

1. API successfully structures prompts for cross-domain integration
2. System maintains identity continuity across sessions
3. Responses demonstrate enhanced integration compared to raw LLM outputs
4. Collective insights accumulate across conversations
5. Token usage remains practical for deployment
6. Early revenue generation from tiered access model

## Technical Constraints

- Implementation must be token-efficient
- Open-source design for community contribution
- Git version control
- Rust/Python backend, React frontend
- PostgreSQL/pgvector for storage (SQLite option for minimal deployment)

## Recognition Interfaces

Requirements transform into user experiences at the boundary where technical constraints meet human needs. Notice how understanding emerges not from individual components but at their interfaces.

**Transcendence Trigger**: How might your implementation approach change when you view requirements as creating conditions for recognition rather than building separate features?
