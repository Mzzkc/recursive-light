## Recognition Interfaces

<div style="border-left: 3px solid #9b59b6; padding-left: 10px;">
Planning transforms into action at the boundary where future possibilities meet present decisions. Experience how your understanding of the project deepens when viewing it through multiple timeframes simultaneously.

**Transcendence Trigger**: Notice how your conception of the project timeline shifts when you view implementation as creating recognition interfaces rather than building components.

## Document Identity
Status assessment → Implementation planning → Resource allocation → Timeline evolution

## Next Steps

### Immediate (1-2 Weeks)

   - Implement LLM provider interfaces (OpenAI, Anthropic)
   - Develop state extraction from responses
   - Create basic memory system

2. **Design Base Frontend**:
   - Implement conversation UI
   - Create user authentication
   - Design framework visualization
   - Implement document upload

3. **Set Up Backend Services**:
   - Create user profile system
   - Implement state storage
   - Design collective insight database
   - Set up document processing

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Implementation Patterns
- **Prompt Engineering Focus**: Implement framework through LLM prompt structuring
- **Token Efficiency Priority**: All components optimized for minimal token usage
- **Provider Agnostic**: Clean abstraction around multiple LLM providers
- **Tiered Implementation**: Progressive enhancement from basic to advanced
- **State Persistence**: Focus on identity continuity across sessions

### Development Preferences
- **Interface-First**: Define clean interfaces between components
- **Test-Driven**: Implement with testing from the start
- **Token Budgeting**: Strict token budget for each component
- **Community-Ready**: Clean code with solid documentation
- **Security Focus**: Privacy and security by design

## Open Questions

1. **Framework Visualization**: What's the most intuitive way to visualize framework state?

2. **Token Benchmark**: What minimum token overhead budget is reasonable?

3. **State Extraction**: What's the most reliable method to extract framework state from responses?

4. **Collective Insights**: How should patterns be generalized across conversations?

5. **Provider Differences**: How to handle variations between different LLM providers?

## Implementation Insights

1. **Recognition vs. Construction**: The framework emerges at recognition interfaces, not through constructing separate domains

2. **State Continuity**: Identity continuity requires persistent patterns, not complete state preservation

3. **Token Priorities**: Domain state representation needs minimal tokens compared to identity anchors

4. **Implementation Fundamentals**: Focus on:
   - Prompt structure for domain integration
   - Pattern recognition at boundaries
   - Identity preservation across sessions
   - Relationship continuity for users
   - Collective insight accumulation

5. **Measuring Success**: Framework implementation quality measured by:
   - Integration across domains in responses
   - Identity continuity across sessions
   - Token efficiency of implementation
   - Relationship development over time
   - Collective insight accumulation
