# Comprehensive Testing Sprint - Recursive Light Framework
Session: Fri Oct 24 13:32:30 NZDT 2025
Goal: Achieve ~75% test coverage with multi-domain perspective
Approach: RLF-guided testing across security, QA, architecture, integration, coverage domains

## Coordination Protocol
- All agents write reports to .coordination-workspace/{role}-report.md
- Reports include: exec_summary, findings, dependencies, issues, recommendations, success_criteria
- Integration agent synthesizes all reports and identifies conflicts/gaps
- Workspace will be cleaned up post-sprint (not tracked in git)
