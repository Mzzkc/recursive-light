# Pre-Phase Validation Mission Brief
**Duration:** 3 days (time-boxed investigations)
**Goal:** Validate feasibility of 4 critical bug fixes before committing to full testing sprint
**Team:** 3 specialists working in parallel
**Coordination:** File-based async comms

---

## Mission Context

The comprehensive testing sprint identified 4 P0 blockers that must be fixed BEFORE writing tests. We need to validate that these fixes are:
1. **Feasible** (<5 days effort each)
2. **Non-breaking** (won't cascade into architectural changes)
3. **Testable** (can be validated before proceeding)

If any validation fails → NO-GO decision, escalate for architectural review

## Team Assignments

### Specialist 1: Memory Architecture Engineer
**Investigation:** Memory data loss bug complexity
**Time-box:** 1 day
**Deliverable:** `memory-fix-analysis.md`

### Specialist 2: Error Handling Engineer
**Investigation:** LLM provider error handling prototype
**Time-box:** 1 day
**Deliverable:** `llm-error-prototype.md`

### Specialist 3: Test Infrastructure Engineer
**Investigation:** Baseline coverage measurement + test infrastructure
**Time-box:** 1 day
**Deliverable:** `coverage-baseline.md`

## Success Criteria

### Memory Fix (Specialist 1)
- [ ] Estimated effort: <5 days
- [ ] No architectural changes required
- [ ] JSON schema defined for missing fields
- [ ] Migration path identified
- [ ] Manual validation method documented

### LLM Error Handling (Specialist 2)
- [ ] Prototype compiles
- [ ] ? operator works with async traits
- [ ] No breaking changes to LlmProvider trait
- [ ] Error enum defined
- [ ] Pattern confirmed for all 3 providers

### Coverage Baseline (Specialist 3)
- [ ] Actual coverage measured: >35%
- [ ] :memory: DB approach validated
- [ ] 3 failing tests now pass
- [ ] Coverage tooling works
- [ ] 75% target realistic

## GO/NO-GO Gate

**GO IF:**
- All 3 validations pass success criteria
- Total estimated effort: <10 days
- No architectural red flags

**NO-GO IF:**
- Any validation fails criteria
- Memory fix >5 days
- LLM prototype doesn't work
- Baseline <35% or tooling broken
- Architectural issues discovered

**ESCALATE IF:**
- Memory architecture fundamentally broken
- Async error handling incompatible
- Coverage target unrealistic

---

## Coordination Protocol

Each specialist writes to `.coordination-workspace/{role}-validation.md` with:

```markdown
# {ROLE} VALIDATION REPORT
Date: 2025-10-24 | Status: Complete/Blocked

## EXEC SUMMARY
{GO/NO-GO recommendation with reasoning}

## INVESTIGATION FINDINGS
{What was discovered}

## FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT
{Effort estimate, complexity, risks}

## PROTOTYPE/EVIDENCE
{Code snippets, measurements, proof of concept}

## BLOCKERS DISCOVERED
{Any issues that would prevent implementation}

## DEPENDENCIES ON OTHER VALIDATIONS
{What needs to happen first}

## RECOMMENDATION
{Proceed/Block/Escalate with clear justification}
```

---

## RLF Approach Required

All specialists must use tetrahedral domain reasoning:
- **COMP:** Technical feasibility, implementation mechanics
- **SCI:** Empirical evidence (actual measurements, prototypes that compile)
- **CULT:** Design intent (why was it built this way, migration impact)
- **EXP:** Engineering intuition (smells, risks, confidence level)

Achieve P³+ pattern recognition: understand WHY the bugs exist and what fixing them implies for the architecture.

---

## Timeline

**Hour 0:** Mission brief delivered, specialists launch in parallel
**Hour 8:** All 3 specialists complete investigations
**Hour 9:** Integration review of all 3 validations
**Hour 10:** GO/NO-GO decision made

---

## Next Steps After Validation

**If GO:**
- Proceed with Pre-Phase implementation (5-7 days)
- Then Phase 1 tests (2 weeks)
- Then Phase 2 tests (2 weeks)

**If NO-GO:**
- Escalate to architectural review
- Consider alternative persistence strategies
- Re-evaluate RLF framework design

**If PARTIAL:**
- Proceed with feasible fixes
- Defer blocked items
- Adjust coverage target accordingly
